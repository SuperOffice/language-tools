Generic is the base type of all other intrinsic CRMScript data types. Any variable can be up-casted to Generic.<p></p>
There's a close connection between Generic and structs.<p></p>
simpler iteration of variables (struct members); easier to access and set new variables in structs; possible to change which variables are members without having to hard-code each field.
